## Tips for Students

1. **Complete Week 0 first** - Python skills are essential for all subsequent weeks
2. **Use developer tools** - Browser inspector is your friend for web scraping
3. **Read the documentation** - Official docs for sklearn, networkx, and pandas are invaluable
4. **Work through APCs** - They directly prepare you for the final assessment
5. **Experiment with parameters** - Open questions encourage exploration
6. **Consider performance** - Large datasets may require subsetting
